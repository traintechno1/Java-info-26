                            Looping Statements
            
        - Loops are used to run the piece of code again and again in a loop.
        - In Loop starting the loop and terminating is important.

      1) For Loop:
        syntax:

          for(initialiser; termination_condition; increment/decrement){
            // the code that you want to run 'n' number of times.
          }

          ex:

            for(int i = 1; i <=15; i++ ){
              System.out.println("Dipika");
            }

      2) While Loop:

          syntax:

            initialiser;

            while(condition){
              the code that you want to run 'n' number of times.

              increment/decrement
            }

            ex:

              int i = 1;
              while(i<=15){
                 System.out.println("Dipika");
                 i++;  
              }


        3) do-while loop:

          syntax:
              
              initialiser;

              do{

                the code that you want to run 'n' number of times.
                increment/decrement

              }while(condition);
