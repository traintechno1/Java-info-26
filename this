                            this Keyword

            -- In Java this Keyword is used to access current class instance.
            -- It is used in various contexts to resolve ambiguity.

            1) It is used to access current class data members:

                Class ABC{
                    int value;

                    // here int value is method variable
                    ABC(int value){
                        //this.value is class variable
                        this.value = value; // this.value accesses the ABC class value variable
                    }
                }

            2) Used to call another constructor in the same class.

            To call another custructor of the same class we can use this() but it sholud always be first statement.

            ex:

            this()
            this(some parameters);

            3) Using this we can return complete object from a method

            ex:

                Human getDetails(){
                    return this;
                }
            
            4) Using this keyword to access Outer class variable inside Inner class method.
