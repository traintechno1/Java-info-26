                                        Constructor

        - Constructor is a special method of a class.
        - Constuctor has same name as a class name and does not have any return type
        - Constructor is used to assign/initialize values to data members.
        - If we dont write any constructor in a class, java will add one default constructor automatically.
        - There are two typs of constructors in java.

        i) Default Constructor
            - Default constructor is a constructor without any parameters.
            - A Class can have only one default constructor.

        ii) Parameterised Constructor

          - Parameterised constructor is a constructor which takes parameters as an input 
            and while calling that constructor we need to pass values to it.
          - We can assign value to some or all data members through parametereised constructor.
          - Parameterised constructor automatically calls the default constructor of the class.
