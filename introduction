                                                    Introduction
            
            - Java is an object oriented programming language.
            - History of java began in 1991 when James Gosling and his team at Sun Microsystem stateted a project called as Green.
            - The goal of the project was to create a programming language for electronic devices like TV or set top boxes.
            - As Java was looking more feasible for WWW it then gets started using in web programming.
            - Java was released in 1995, it was then renamed to Oak.
            - Then renamed to Java.
            - The first version of java release was 1.0

            - Now using java we can develop web, mobile or desktop applications.
            - Sun Microsystem sold the Java to Oracle and now Oracle manages Java.

              Features of Java:

                Object Oriented: 
                  - everything in java is an object, its an programming paradigm its an method to simplify the software code.
                     
                      - Class
                      - Object
                      - Inheritance
                      - Polymorphism
                      - Abstraction
                      - Encapsulation

                Simple: 
                  - Java is easy to learn and syntax of is simple and easy.
                  - Java has removed concepts like operator overloading, pointers to make program simple and avoid technical complications.
                
                Automatic Garbage Collection:
                  - It automatically destroys the object created, we dont need to destroy the object once they are done with its use.

                Platform Independent:
                  - Java code gets converted into a byte code and that byte code is platform indendent.
                  - As JVM(Java Virtual Machine) compiles the code into machine readable byte code which can be executed any number of 
                    time, that's why java is called as write once and run anywhere language.
                  
                Robust:
                  Java is really strong language because of its strong memory management, and lack of pointers which avoids security issues.
                  Java has exception handling which helps in run time program issues.


                
                
                
            - Java Editions:

            Java SE(Standard Edition)
            Java EE(Enterprise Edition)
            Java ME(Micro Edition)
            Java FX



            JDK, JVM, JRE:




            Execution of .java program


            We first compile the .java program, the .class file for each class in .java file gets created which is a machine readable code also called as bytecode, it created by JVM.



            index.java        -----------> First.class    -------------->     
        it has a class                   File gets created                  Run .class file us java
        -- First                          using javac
