                                        Polymorphism
        - poly means multiple, morphus means forms of a method.
        - A method having multiple forms is called as polymorphism.
        - A method having different signature is a polymorphism.

        What is method signature?
        - Method name with type of parameters or number of parameters.
        - Methods with different return types but same no of or type of parameters are not different signature.

        1) void printDetails(){

        }

        2) void printDetails(){

        }

        here method 1 and 2 are not different method signature.

        3) void printDetails(){

        }

        4) void printDetails(int a){

        }

        here method 3 and 4 are different method signature because 3 has 0 parameters and 4 has one parameter.

        5) void printDetails(String a){

        }

        6) void printDetails(int a){

        }

        7) void printDetails(char a){

        }

        here method 5 and 6 are different method signature because 5 has 1 parameter of type string
         and 6 has one parameter of type int.


         Test t1 = new Test();

        #  t1.printDetails();
         t1.printDetails(10);
         t1.printDetails("10");
         t1.printDetails('10');


        Types of Polymorphism:
        1) Compile Time Polymorphism(Method Overloading)


        2) Run Time Polymorphism

            Which Overriden method to be called is decided at run time hence it is called as Run Time polymorphism.
            
            - Upcasting:
                When Reference variable of a parent class is storing object oc child class is called as
                upcasting.

                Example:

                    Class Parent{

                    }

                    Class Child extends Parent{

                    }


                    Parent p = new Child(); // upcasting

                    p is reference of Parent class is storing (new Child()) which is object of Child class.
