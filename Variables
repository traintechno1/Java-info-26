                                        Variable
    - Vari + able -> Ability To change
    - Variable is the container which can hold some value and we can change it in the program execution.


    1000 to store this value first I need to understand what type of value is this?

    Datatypes:
        1) Built in datatypes/ Primitive Datatypes:

            Whole Numbers ex: (354665)
            - byte           -> 1Byte
            - short          -> 2Bytes
            - int            -> 4Bytes
            - long           -> 8Bytes

            Decimal Numbers ex: (6542.21)
            - float          -> 4Bytes 
            - double         -> 8Bytes

            - char        -> 2Bytes can accept any single character in single quotes ex: 'a' , '1', '@' etc.
            - boolean     -> 1Byte (true / false)


        2) User Defined Datatypes:
            - class
            ex:
            String 
            "Technogeeks"


        To Create a variable in Java: 
        - As Java is typed programming language every variable in java should have datatype.

        Syntax:

        DataType variable_name = value; // variable declarartion with assignment
        DataType variable_name; // variable declarartion

        ex:

        int val = 200; // variable declarartion with assignment
        char c;  // variable declarartion

        Keyword:
            keywords are the reserved words which has certain meaning or work in the programming language.

        Rules To give the variable name:
            - Variable names can not be keyword.
            - Variable names are case sensitive.
            - Variable name should always starts with letter (a to z, A to Z or _, $)
            - In a variable name after first character we can add numbers, and only two special symbols are allowed that is (_ or $), no other special symbols can be used in a variable name.
