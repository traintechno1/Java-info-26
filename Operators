                                    Operators

        - Operators are the symbols which are used to perform some operation on the operands.

        variable = value // allowed
        value = anotherValue // not allowed (compile time error or syntax error)

        variable1 = variable2; // This is allowed provided when value of variable2 is compatible to be stored in variable1

        1) Arithmetic Operators
            i) Addition (+)
                ex:
                    c = a + b;

            ii) Substraction (-)
                ex:
                    c = b - a;

            iii) Multiplication (*)
                ex:
                    c = b * a;

            iv) Division (/)
                ex:
                    c = b / a;
                
            v) Modulus (%) -> returns the remainder
                ex:
                    c = a % b;
            
        2) Comparison Operators:
            These operators are used to compare values and returns boolean result (true/false).

            i) Equal to (==)                
                ex:
                    a == b 

            ii) Not Equal to (!=) (Tip: it is a combination of ! and = but their is no space between ! and =)
                ex: 
                    a != b;
                
            iii) Greater Than(>)
                ex:
                    a > b -> going to check value of left is greater than value on right
            
            iv) Less Than(<)
                ex:
                    a < b -> going to check value of left is less than value on right

            iv) Less Than equal to(<=) (Tip: it is a combination of < and = but their is no space between < and =)
                ex:
                    a <= b -> going to check value of left is less than or equal value on right

            iv) Greater Than Equal to(>=) (Tip: it is a combination of > and = but their is no space between > and =)
                ex:
                    a >= b -> going to check value of left is greater than or equal to value on right

        3) Assignment Operators:
            i) Assignment (=):
                Assigns value of right of (=) to the left variable. 
                -On left side of = we can only have variable, we can not have value of left.
            
            ii) Addition Assignment (+=):
                Ex:
                int a = 100;
                a += 10 ==> a = a + 10;

            iii) Substraction Assignment (-=):
                Ex:
                int a = 100;
                a -= 10 ==> a = a - 10;

            iv) Multiplication Assignment (-=):
                Ex:
                int a = 100;
                a *= 10 ==> a = a * 10;

            v) Division Assignment (-=):
                Ex:
                int a = 100;
                a /= 10 ==> a = a / 10;

            vi) Modulus Assignment (-=):
                Ex:
                int a = 100;
                a %= 10 ==> a = a % 10;

        4) Logical Operators:
            i) AND (&&):
                In && even if single value is false result is false.
                Truth Table:

                  a      b          result
                true    true        true
                true    false       false
                false   true        false
                false   false       false

                (*)
                1   1   1
                0   1   0
                1   0   0
                0   0   0



                1000 * 80 * 0 => 0

            ii) OR (||):
                    In || even if single value is true result is true.
                +

                1000 + 80 + 0 => 1080

                    Truth Table:

                      a      b          result
                    true    true        true
                    true    false       true
                    false   true        true
                    false   false       false

            iii) NOT (!):
                It reverse the value.

                Truth Table

                    a           result
                    true        false
                    false       true

        5) Unary Operators:
            Unary operators are the operators which works only on single operand.
            i) Increment (++):
                
                a) Pre Increment: 
                    ex:
                        ++a;  => a = a + 1;
                
                b) Post Increment:
                    ex:
                        a++;  => a = a + 1;

            ii) Decrement (--):

                a) Pre Decrement: 
                    ex:
                        --a;  => a = a - 1;
                
                b) Post Decrement:
                    ex:
                        a--;  => a = a - 1;

        6) Ternary Operator: (? : )

            condition ? 'if condition result is true' : 'if condition result is false';

            ex:

                String result =  a > 200 ? "A is bigger" : "A is smaller";
