                                            Final

                - final keyword is used to restrict the user.
                - we can use final keyword on
                    - data members
                    - member functions
                    - class

            - final datamembers:
                - the variable which is final has to get a value when it is declared, otherwise we can assign value to it in default constructor but not in any other method.
                - once we assign value to final variable its value can not be changed further.

                ex:
                    final float PI = 3.14f;

                    PI = 5; // gets an compile time error

            - final methods:
                - a method which is final, that method can not be overriden by child class.
                - we can not have overriden method in child class for final method.
                - make a method as final only when you dont want the child class to override certain method.

        
            - final Class:
                - If we make any class as final it can not be inherited.
                - no other class can extends the final class.
