                                        Array   
        
            - Array is a collection of elements of similar datatype.
            - Array has index to access the values in it.
            - Array index always starts with 0
            - That means last index of the array is always size - 1;

            int a = 100;

            -- memory of 4 bytes gets allocated.
            -- this memory has some memory address.


            16GB -> 16 * 1024 * 1024 * 1024

            4bytes


            Now we want to declare an array of 10 integere values;
                
                4 * 10 = 40 bytes is the memory space required
                
            with this there will be an memory allocation of 40 bytes.

            Syntax:

                datatype array_name[] = new datatype[size_of_array];

            ex:
             - I want to declare an array of integer to store 10 values.

                int arr[] = new int[10];

            
            - To access the array element

                name_of_array[index];
