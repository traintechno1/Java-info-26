                                        Abstraction
            - Abstraction is process of hiding the implementation details 
              and only showing functionality to the users.
            - To achieve Abstraction we have a keyword 'abstract'
            - when a method is prefixed with abstract keyword we can only define the method and not implement it.
            - the method which is abstract can not have body/ implementation right there.
            ex:

            abstract void print(); // valid

            abstract void print(){  //invalid

            }
