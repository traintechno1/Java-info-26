                                Package
        - package is used to group classes and interfaces together.
        - In a single package any class or interface can come only once, but in different package you can use 
            that class name. so it is basically solving naming conflict problem.

        Packages are basically of two types:
            1) Built In Packages
                - these are the packages provided by java in JDK
                ex: java.util, java.lang, java.sql ......
            
            2) User Defined Packages
                To create user defined packages we use keyword as package.
                that user defined package will have classes and interfaces.


                - If A class or interface belongs to other package and want to use it in different package
                    we need to import it.
                - But if class or interface belongs to same package we can directly use it for inheritance or
                    creating object without import.
