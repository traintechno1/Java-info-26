            -- database is used to store the data in a specific format.
            -- datatbases are of different types based on the kind of infomration that we want to store in it.

                                                Relational Database

            -- in a relational databases data is stored in the form of table.
            -- table is the collection of rows and columns.
            -- RDBMS (Relational Database Management System)
            -- To implement RDBM we use query languages like mysql, postgresql, oracle..

            -- based on operation we want to perform on the database there are following categories of queries:
            i) Data Defination Language (DDL):
                -- DDL Queries helps in creating, managing the structure of the database and tables. 
            ii) Data Manipulation Language (DML):
                -- DML queriees helps in storing and manipulating the data.
