                                Inheritance

    -- Inheritance is the process of acquiring properties and methods of a parent class.

            class Parent{
                // data members
                int id;
                String name;
                String address;
            }

            class Child{
                int id;
                String childName;
            }

    -- if Child class wants all the properties from Parent class then Child class can inherit Parent class.
    -- To achieve the inheritance we have extends as a keyword.
    -- Parent class is also called as superclass.
    -- Child class is also called as subclass or derived class.


    -- When we have parent child relation(inheritance) the child class contructor automatically calls
        parent class default constructor, hence we should have parent class default constructor.


    syntax:

        class ParentClassName{
            // data members
            // member functions
        }


        class ChildClassName extends ParentClassName{
            // data members
            // member functions

            // but it can use parent class data members and parent class member functions
        }

    ex:

        class Child extends Parent{
            int id;
            String childName;
        }


        Class A{

        }

        Class B extends A{

        }

        here B is a Child of A, thats why relation is called as "IS-A" relation.



        Based on Combinations of Parent Child relations we can have following types of inheritances in Java:

        1) Single Inheritance
        2) MultiLevel Inheritance
        3) Hierarchical Inheritance
        4) Hybrid Inheritance
        5) Multiple Inheritance


        1) Single Inheritance:
            - in a single inheritance one child gets derived form one parent class

                            Parent Class
                                |
                                |
                                |
                            Child Class

        2) MultiLevel Inheritance:
            - in multiLevel inheritance there can be n-layers of parent child relation.
            - here class B has access to properties and methods of class A,
            Class C has access to properties and methods of Class A and Class B.

                            Class A
                                |
                                |
                                |
                            Class B
                                |
                                |
                                |
                            Class C

        
        3) Hierarchical Inheritance:
            - In Hierarchical Inheritance their will be one parent class and multiple child classes.
            - Here class B, C, D can access properties and methods of class A, but B can not access C or D and 
                C can not access B and D, D can not access B and C...


                                        Class A
                                           |
                --------------------------------------------------------
                |                          |                            |
            Class B                     Class C                     Class D

            Here B, C and D are called as siblings.

        
        4) Hybrid Inheritance:
            Hybrid Inheritance is the combination of all the inheritance types.

                                        Class A
                                           |
                --------------------------------------------------------------
                |                           |                                 |
            Class B                     Class C                             Class D
                |                                                             |
                |                                                             |
            Class E                                                         Class G
                |                                                             
                |                                                             
            Class F                          

                
        5) Multiple Inheritance:
            - Mutiple Inheritance is not allowed in java.

                                Class A                     Class B
                                   |                           |
                                   |                           |
                                    ---------------------------
                                                |
                                                |
                                              Class C



                        Class Person                   Class Human           
                        - String name               - int noOfLimbs;        
                        - int age                   - String name;  
                        - print()                   - print()    


                                        Class Student extends Person
                                        display(){
                                            print()
                                            System.out.println("Name: " + name);
                                        }
